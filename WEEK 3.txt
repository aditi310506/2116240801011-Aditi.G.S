Objective 
In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements.

 Task 


Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

 

·         If n is odd, print Weird

·         If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird

·         If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird

·         If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

 

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.

 

Input Format

 

A single line containing a positive integer, n.

 

Constraints

 

·         1 < n < 100

 

Output Format

 

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

 

Sample Input 0

 

3

 

Sample Output 0

 

Weird

 

Sample Input 1

 

24

 

Sample Output 1

 

Not Weird

 

Explanation

 

Sample Case 0:  n = 3

n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.



Sample Case 1:  n = 24

n > 20 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.


Answer:

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
int n;
scanf("%d",&n);
if (n%2!=0){
printf("Weird");
}
if (n>=2 && n<=5){
if (n%2==0){
printf("Not Weird");
}
}
if (n>=6 && n<=20){
if (n%2==0){
printf("Weird");
}
}
if (n>20 && n%2==0){
printf("Not Weird");
}
}

3]Three numbers form a Pythagorean triple if the sum of squares of two numbers is equal to the square of the third. For example, 3, 5 and 4 form a Pythagorean triple, since 3*3 + 4*4 = 25 = 5*5 You are given three integers, a, b, and c. They need not be given in increasing order. If they form a Pythagorean triple, then print "yes", otherwise, print "no". Please note that the output message is in small letters. Sample Input 1 3 5 4 Sample Output 1 yes Sample Input 2 5 8 2 Sample Output 2 no

7] Positions on a chess board are identiﬁed by a letter and a number. The letter identiﬁes the column, while the number identiﬁes the row, as shown below:
Write a program that reads a position from the user. Use an if statement to determine if the column begins with a black square or a white square. Then use modular arithmetic to report the color of the square in that row. For example, if the user enters a1 then your program should report that the square is black. If the user enters d5 then your program should report that the square is white. Your program may assume that a valid position will always be entered. It does not need to perform any error checking.


Sample Input 1

 

a 1

 

Sample Output 1

 

The square is black.

8] Some data sets specify dates using the year and day of year rather than the year, month, and day of month. The day of year (DOY) is the sequential day number starting with day 1 on January 1st.


There are two calendars - one for normal years with 365 days, and one for leap years with 366 days. Leap years are divisible by 4. Centuries, like 1900, are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. So, 2000 was a leap year.

 
To find the day of year number for a standard date, scan down the Jan column to find the day of month, then scan across to the appropriate month column and read the day of year number. Reverse the process to find the standard date for a given day of year.


Write a program to print the Day of Year of a given date, month and year.

9] Suppandi is trying to take part in the local village math quiz. In the first round, he is asked about shapes and areas. Suppandi, is confused, he was never any good at math. And also, he is bad at remembering the names of shapes. Instead, you will be helping him calculate the area of shapes.

 

·         When he says rectangle he is actually referring to a square. 

·         When he says square, he is actually referring to a triangle.

·         When he says triangle he is referring to a rectangle

·         And when he is confused, he just says something random. At this point, all you can do is say 0.

 

Help Suppandi by printing the correct answer in an integer.

 

Input Format

 

·         Name of shape (always in upper case R à Rectangle, S à Square, T à Triangle)

·         Length of 1 side

·         Length of other side

 

Note: In case of triangle, you can consider the sides as height and length of base
