WEEK 13

1] Calculate the sum of an array of integers.

 

Example

 

numbers = [3, 13, 4, 11, 9]

 

The sum is 3 + 13 + 4 + 11 + 9 = 40.

 

Function Description

 

Complete the function arraySum in the editor below.

 

arraySum has the following parameter(s):

int numbers[n]: an array of integers

 

Returns

int: integer sum of the numbers array

 

Constraints

 

1 ≤ n ≤ 104

1 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 104

 

Input Format for Custom Testing

 

Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.

 

The first line contains an integer n, the size of the array numbers.

Each of the next n lines contains an integer numbers[i] where 0 ≤ i < n.

2] Given an array of n integers, rearrange them so that the sum of the absolute differences of all adjacent elements is minimized. Then, compute the sum of those absolute differences. Example n = 5 arr = [1, 3, 3, 2, 4] If the list is rearranged as arr' = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4], the absolute differences are |1 - 2| = 1, |2 - 3| = 1, |3 - 3| = 0, |3 - 4| = 1. The sum of those differences is 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3. Function Description Complete the function minDiff in the editor below. minDiff has the following parameter: arr: an integer array Returns: int: the sum of the absolute differences of adjacent elements Constraints 2 ≤ n ≤105 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109, where 0 ≤ i < n Input Format For Custom Testing The first line of input contains an integer, n, the size of arr. Each of the following n lines contains an integer that describes arr[i] (where 0 ≤ i < n) . Sample Case 0 Sample Input For Custom Testing STDIN Function ----- -------- 5 → arr[] size n = 5 5 → arr[] = [5, 1, 3, 7, 3] 1 3 7 3 Sample Output 6 Explanation n = 5 arr = [5, 1, 3, 7, 3] If arr is rearranged as arr' = [1, 3, 3, 5, 7], the differences are minimized. The final answer is |1 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 5| + |5 - 7| = 6. Sample Case 1 Sample Input For Custom Testing STDIN Function ----- -------- 2 → arr[] size n = 2 3 → arr[] = [3, 2] 2 Sample Output 1 Explanation n = 2 arr = [3, 2] There is no need to rearrange because there are only two elements. The final answer is |3 - 2| = 1.
